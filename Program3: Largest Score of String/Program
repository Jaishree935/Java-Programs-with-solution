Question:
Largest score of given String

The program must accept a string S and N words as the input.
The string S always contains exactly 26 lower case alphabets in any order. 
The position of an alphabet in the string S represents the score of the alphabet. 
The program must find the score of each word among the N words by finding the sum of scores of each alphabet in the word. 
Then the program must print the word which has the maximum score as the output. 
If two or more words have the same maximum score, the program must print the first occurring word as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N, Length of each word <= 100 

Input Format: 
The first line contains S. 
The second line contains N. The next N lines, each contains a string value. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the word which has the maximum score. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 
5 
pen gold doll coin book 

Output: doll 

Explanation: 
Here N = 5. 
The 5 words and their scores are given below. 
pen - 35 (16+5+14) 
gold - 38 (7+15+12+4) 
doll - 43 (4+15+12+12) 
coin - 41 (3+15+9+14) 
book - 43 (2+15+15+11) 
The words doll and book have the same maximum score, so the first occurring word doll is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 
zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba 
4 
pencil horse candle cookie 

Output: candle Max Execution

Code:
import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Your Code Here
          Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in); //scanner class for getting the input 
          String S=s.nextLine(); //getting the input from String 
          int n=s.nextInt();   // get the n as integer  eg: 5\n  
         //s.nextLine();
          String[] s1 = new String[100];
          for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
s1[i]=s.nextLine(); /* poll dog cat pig null  it not get the n string as input it only get the n-1 string as input from user*/
          }
          int sum=0,index=0;
          for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
              String l=s1[i];
              int k=l.length();
              int c=0;//here it store the score of the word for temporary only
              for(int m=0;m<k;m++){
                   c=c+((S.indexOf(l.charAt(m)))+1); //m it has the index value chatAt()return the character 
              } //because the string from a to z its score value we assume it from 1 to 26 
              if(c>sum){
                  sum=c;
                  index=i; // it contain the maximum score of the string word index value 
              }
          }
          System.out.println(s1[index]); //display the output as max score of the words
              System.out.println(s1[n-1]);
	}
}
