Question:
Next Integer - Same 1s Count

Question:
The program must accept an integer N as the input.
The program must print the next largest integer of N with the same number of 1s as in the binary representation of N. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N <= 10^8 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N. 

Output Format: 

The first line contains the next largest integer of N with the same number of 1s as in the binary representation of N. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 9 
Output: 10 
Explanation: The binary representation of 9 is 1001. 
The number of 1s in 1001 is 2. 
The integer 10 is the next largest integer of 9 with two 1s. 
The binary representation of 10 is 1010. 
So 10 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 128 
Output: 256 

Example Input/Output 3: 
Input: 1 
Output: 2



Code:
 import java.util.Scanner;

public class NextLargestWithSameOnes {
    // Function to count the number of 1's in the binary representation of a number
    public static int countOnes(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            count += (num & 1); // Check the least significant bit
            num >>= 1; // Right-shift the number to check the next bit
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);//for getting the input string
        
        // Input the integer N
        int N = sc.nextInt(); //get the input val
        
        // Count the number of 1's in the binary representation of N
        int originalOnes = countOnes(N);
        
        // Find the next number with the same number of 1's
        int nextNumber = N + 1;
        while (countOnes(nextNumber) != originalOnes) {
            nextNumber++;
        }
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println(nextNumber);
        
        sc.close();
    }
}
