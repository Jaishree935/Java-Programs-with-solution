Sum of Digits - Divisible by K 

Question:
The program must accept two integers N and K as the input. 
The program must print the count of integers from 1 to N having the sum of digits divisible by K. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N <= 10^5 
1 <= K <= 100 

Input Format: 
The first line contains N and K separated by a space. 

Output Format: 
The first line contains an integer representing the count of integers from 1 to N having the 
sum of digits divisible by K.

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 30 4 
Output: 6 

Explanation: 
Here N = 30 and K = 4. 
There are 6 integers from 1 to 30 having the sum of digits divisible by 4. 
4 8 13 17 22 26 
So 6 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 100 10 
Output: 9 

Explanation: 
Here N = 100 and K = 10. 
There are 9 integers from 1 to 100 having the sum of digits divisible by 10. 
19 28 37 46 55 64 73 82 91 
So 9 is printed as the output.

        int K = scanner.nextInt();  
        scanner.close();
        int count = 0;
 
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            int sum = 0, num = i;
            // Compute the sum of digits of the number
            while (num > 0) {
                sum += num % 10;  
                num /= 10;        
            }
            if (sum % K == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
