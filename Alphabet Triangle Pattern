Question:

Alphabets Triangle Pattern 

Question:

Given an integer N which indicates the position in the alphabet series (upper case) and another integer R which indicates the number of rows to be printed, the program must print R rows with each row containing alphabets equal to the row count. 

Boundary Condition(s): 

1 <= N <= 26 1 <= R <= 26 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 4 5 

Output: 
D 
D E 
D E F 
D E F G 
D E F G H 

Explanation: 
4 indicates the fourth alphabet which is D. 
5 indicates the number of rows to be printed. 
Row 1: One alphabet starting from D is printed.
       D 
Row 2: Two alphabets starting from D are printed. 
       D E 
Row 3: Three alphabets starting from D are printed. 
       D E F 
Row 4: Four alphabets starting from D are printed. 
       D E F G 
Row 5: Five alphabets starting from D are printed. 
       D E F G H 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 25 4 
Output: 
Y 
Y Z 
Y Z A 
Y Z A B 

Program:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class AlphabetTriangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Input: N (position in the alphabet series) and R (number of rows)
        int N = scanner.nextInt();
        int R = scanner.nextInt();
        char startChar = (char) ('A' + N - 1); // Calculate the starting alphabet
        // Print the triangle pattern
        for (int i = 1; i <= R; i++) { // Iterate through rows
            char currentChar = startChar;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) { // Print characters in each row
                System.out.print(currentChar + " ");
                currentChar++;
                // Wrap around to 'A' if the character exceeds 'Z'
                if (currentChar > 'Z') {
                    currentChar = 'A';
                }
            }
            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
