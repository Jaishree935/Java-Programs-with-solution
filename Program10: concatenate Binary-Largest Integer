concatenate Binary - Largest Integer 

Question:
The program must accept two integers X and Y as the input. 
The program must print the largest possible integer which is formed by concatenating the binary representations of X and Y as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= X, Y <= 10^4 
Input Format: 
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
 
Output Format: 
The first line contains the largest possible integer which is formed by concatenating the binary representations of X and Y. 

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 7 10 
Output: 122 

Explanation: 
The binary representation of 7 is 111. 
The binary representation of 10 is 1010. 
The largest possible integer formed is 122 and its binary representation is 1111010. 
So 122 is printed as the output. 

Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: 8 5 
Output: 88



Program:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ConcatenateBinaryLargest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input X and Y
        int X = sc.nextInt();
        int Y = sc.nextInt();

        // Convert X and Y to binary strings
        String binaryX = Integer.toBinaryString(X);
        String binaryY = Integer.toBinaryString(Y);

        // Concatenate binary strings in both possible orders
        String concat1 = binaryX + binaryY;
        String concat2 = binaryY + binaryX;

        // Convert concatenated binary strings to integers
        int num1 = Integer.parseInt(concat1, 2);
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(concat2, 2);

        // Print the larger of the two numbers
        System.out.println(Math.max(num1, num2));
    }
}
